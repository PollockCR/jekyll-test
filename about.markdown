This is your about page! It is build with [Markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

You can make words **bold** and other words *italic*. You can [link to Google!](http://google.com)

You can create numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

You can create unordered lists:

 * Start a line with a star
 * Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well to make unordered lists
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

You can also embed images:

## Structured content

Different levels of headings help to structure your content. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the `>` character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
>
> \- Captain Janeway

The `-` is used to "escape" a character, so that it displays as is, instead of being recognized as a markdown list.

There are many different ways to style code with markdown.

If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.

If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

Another way to include a longer block of code is to wrap it in three backticks, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
